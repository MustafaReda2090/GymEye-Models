Deep Learning models for the graduation project from Faculty of Computers and Information Kafr-El-Shiekh University

##Overview
It is important while performing specific exercise to know the best and right poses that help building a good healthy body and keep good fitness otherwise, you will suffer pain and injuries and take long time to recover from the side effects of ignoring the right instructions and poses of exercises. Also, it is costly to afford a personal coach or trainer to help practicing exercise in right way. So, we decided to build an exercise pose correction application that detects specific errors in videos recorded by user and suggests the right pose or way to perform that exercise, displaying instructions and images clarifying available exercises in the system.
